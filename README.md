This dataset contains data from the network of Arctic Ice Mass Balance Buoys deployed between 1993 and 2015, reprocessed after West (2020).
The interfaces of 41 SIMB3 buoys were identified using a combination of temperature data and data from acoustic sounders.
The dataset processing was supported by the Research Council of Norway project INTERAAC (grant no. 328957).
